# MeatScanner: Meat Nutrition Analyzer

A modern web application for scanning meat and analyzing nutritional content with a health-focused design.

## Overview

MeatScanner is a web-based application that allows users to scan meat products with their device camera and instantly receive detailed nutritional information including calories, protein, fat, and vitamins.

## Features

- **AI Meat Detection**: Advanced AI that recognizes different types of meat
- **Complete Nutritional Analysis**: Get detailed nutritional breakdown of scanned meats
- **Modern Green Design**: Clean, health-focused interface with a modern aesthetic
- **Responsive Layout**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Smart Recommendations**: Cooking tips and health insights based on meat type

## Technology Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with animations)
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- Camera API
- AI-powered meat recognition

## Demo

You can try the live demo by visiting the GitHub Pages deployment of this repository.

## How It Works

This application uses the device camera to capture an image of meat. In a production environment, this image would be sent to an AI-powered meat recognition API that uses machine learning to identify the specific type of meat and return detailed nutritional data. For demonstration purposes, this version simulates the AI recognition with pre-defined meat data.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. Click "Start Scanning" to begin
4. Point your camera at any meat (beef, chicken, pork, fish, etc.)
5. Get instant nutritional information

## Target Users

- Health-conscious individuals
- Fitness enthusiasts
- Athletes tracking protein intake
- Bodybuilders monitoring macros
- People on specialized diets (keto, paleo, etc.)

## Note

This is a demo application. In a real-world implementation, it would require:

- An AI-powered meat recognition API
- User authentication
- Cloud data storage for saving nutritional history
- Native mobile app versions for better camera integration
